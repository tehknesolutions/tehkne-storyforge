# TEHKNÉ STORYFORGE

> **Forge an idea into a universe.**

TEHKNÉ STORYFORGE is a narrative creation and transmedia production system by Tehkné Solutions.

Its purpose is not merely to generate stories. Storyforge transforms a creative intention into a structured narrative universe and then derives multiple coherent media manifestations from the same canonical source.

## Core flow

```text
ALEF / INTENTION
→ STORY DNA
→ WORLD + CANON
→ CHARACTER MIND
→ EVENT / FABULA
→ DISCOURSE / SYUZHET
→ EXPERIENCE
→ T-NIR
→ MEDIA COMPILERS
→ MEDIA ARTIFACTS
```

## Product architecture

- **TEHKNÉ STORYFORGE** — complete product.
- **TNE — Tehkné Narrative Engine** — narrative runtime and orchestration layer.
- **T-NIR — Tehkné Narrative Intermediate Representation** — media-independent narrative representation.
- **Story Lab** — creator-facing workspace.
- **Canon Graph** — canonical truth and relationship graph.
- **Narrative Director** — pacing, dramatic and continuity orchestration.
- **Media Compilers** — project the same T-NIR universe into different media.

These are **media profiles**, not interchangeable labels. Manga, Webtoon and Anime, for example, may share canonical events while using different pacing, composition, production units and presentation grammars.

## Core principles

1. **Creator Authority** — AI may propose; canon changes require creator approval.
2. **Canon-first** — continuity is part of the architecture, not a final QA patch.
3. **Event-first** — canonical events are more fundamental than scenes or pages.
4. **Mind ≠ Canon** — what a character believes may differ from what is true.
5. **Media-agnostic core** — external text/image/audio/video models are replaceable adapters.
6. **Hybrid Narrative** — supports authored and emergent storytelling.
7. **Provenance** — important facts and generated artifacts must be traceable.
8. **Transmedia by design** — each medium may reinterpret presentation without silently changing canon.

## Repository status

**Foundation V0.1 — Research → Executable Specification**

Initial goals:

- formalize T-NIR;
- define TypeScript domain types;
- define JSON Schema validation;
- define first-class Media Profiles;
- build a reference micro-universe;
- compile it to prose, interactive narrative and storyboard/anime-style sequence;
- measure canonical and causal preservation.
